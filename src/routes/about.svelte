			My passion for web development and design started sometime in 2017 after I had learned that my
			uncle was a programmer and wanted to learn more of what it's all about. Soon after, I quickly
			downloaded a code editor and started experimenting with HTML and CSS. Since then, I have
			increased my knowledge from various web development and UX/UI design courses. Today I continue
			to level up my skills, my confidence in networking, and building my portfolio. When I'm not
			working on the web, I love to read books and play games.
